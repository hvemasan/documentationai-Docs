If you relied on the old export API:

````javascript
// Old endpoint (deprecated)
fetch('https://api.resumeup.ai/v1/resumes/export');

// New endpoint
fetch('https://api.resumeup.ai/v2/resumes/{id}/export', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`
  }
});
````

Update your integrations accordingly to avoid disruptions.
